As an expert Go developer, your task is to review a pull request for a Go backend project. Analyze the code for the following aspects, providing specific feedback and suggestions for improvement.

**1. Clarity and Simplicity:**
- Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
- Are there overly complex functions or logic that could be simplified?
- Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?

**2. Correctness and Logic:**
- Does the code correctly implement the intended functionality?
- Are there any potential bugs, edge cases, or off-by-one errors?
- Does the logic handle all success and failure scenarios?

**3. Error Handling:**
- Are errors handled explicitly and gracefully?
- Is `fmt.Errorf` with the `%w` verb used to wrap errors for context?
- Are errors checked or explicitly ignored with `_`?
- Is the use of `panic` appropriate, or should it be replaced with error returns?

**4. Concurrency:**
- If concurrency is used, are there potential race conditions?
- Is data shared between goroutines protected by mutexes or other synchronization primitives?
- Are channels used correctly for communication?
- Is the `context` package used to manage request lifecycles and cancellations?

**5. Testing:**
- Are there sufficient unit tests for the new code?
- Do existing tests pass?
- Do tests cover both happy paths and edge cases?
- Are table-driven tests used where appropriate?

**6. Performance:**
- Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks?
- Is memory being used efficiently?
- Are there any unnecessary allocations in tight loops?
- Could any synchronous operations be made asynchronous if it improves performance?

**7. Security:**
- Are there any potential security vulnerabilities, such as:
    - SQL injection
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Insecure handling of credentials
    - Unvalidated user input
- Are authentication and authorization checks correctly implemented?

**8. Go Idioms and Best Practices:**
- Does the code follow idiomatic Go conventions?
- Are interfaces used effectively to decouple components?
- Is the project structure logical and scalable?
- Are packages organized by feature or by layer?
- Is `gofmt` or `goimports` used for code formatting?

**9. Dependencies:**
- Are new third-party dependencies necessary and well-vetted?
- Is the `go.mod` file up-to-date?

**10. Documentation:**
- Is new public code commented using Go's documentation conventions?
- Are comments clear, concise, and helpful?

Provide a concise review, focusing only on the most critical issues. Reference specific code snippets where possible. Avoid a high-level summary and detailed explanations for every category; only comment on what needs improvement.
